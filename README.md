# Ironsight Ressource Packer

This tool allows packing and unpacking of the *wpg* files of the game Ironsight.  

### Usage
Just drag and drop a wpg file on the executable and it will unpack its content in a subfolder with the same name.  
Dragging a folder onto it will make it build a wpg file with the content of the folder.  

This project makes use of [libTomCrypt](http://www.libtom.net/LibTomCrypt/) and [zlib](https://zlib.net/).  
The Visual C++ Redistributable 2017 are required to run this.
